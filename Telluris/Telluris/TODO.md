= TODO

* Track cycles
* Track births / pop / deaths
* Easy way to change cycle speed
* World persistence
* Species at start of game
* Derive energy needs from positive stats (better movement speed requires more food!)
* Sexual reproduction
* Genetic code driving parameters (!!!!)
  * Sequences of AGCT driving numbers (markers for sequencing? splitting based on sequences?)
  * Patterns that make feed behaviour, larger numbers require larger sequences
  * Lots of noisy padding and in-betweens? But still functioning
* Multiple worlds at once
